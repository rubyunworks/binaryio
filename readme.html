<h1>BinaryIO</h1>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>BinaryIO class is used to read and write binary data.</p>

<p>The BinaryIO class is built on the reusable mixins `BinaryIO::Readable` and
`BinaryIO::Writable`. Readable solely depends one method, `#read(n)`, which
must be defined in the class/module where the module is mixed. Likewise
Writeable depends on `write(str)`.</p>

<h2>HISTORY</h2>

<p>Almost all of BinaryIO’s code was written by Michael Neumann as
<tt>BinaryReader</tt>,  <tt>BinaryWriter</tt> and <tt>ByteOrder</tt>. These
modules were distributed with Ruby Facets for some time, but when Facets
began to strip itself of most non core extension libraries in 2009, these
scripts were spun off as a separate project and reorganized to become the
BinaryIO library.</p>
